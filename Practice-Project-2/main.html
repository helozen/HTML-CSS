            The Muslims of Bangladesh have boycotted the products of various companies, including Coca-Cola, which are related to Israel. There is a heated discussion in Bangladesh about these boycotts. That is why the sales of Bangladeshi product Mojo soft drink has increased tremendously and compared to 2023 the sales of Coca Cola in Bangladesh has decreased by 60 percent this year (2024).
